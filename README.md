# The Annotated YOLO
Inspired by the the legendary <a href="https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html">"The Annotated Transformer"</a> This project aims to build an intuitive implementation of the YOLO model from scratch.<br><br>
It is an iterative effort to implement all the features that make YOLO so great with a heavy emphasis on being easy to understand without sacrificing efficiency or performance. <br><br>
 Currently implementing the "build targets" and Loss computation mechanisms.<br>
